LibreOffice printing options
----------------------------------------------------------------------

General printing options
After you install a printer on a computer, the general printing options for LibreOffice can be
customized. Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Print (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences >
LibreOffice > Print) to open the Options LibreOffice Print dialog (Figure 15). The general print
options for LibreOffice are as follows:
Settings for
Specifies whether the print settings apply to direct printing or to printing to a file.
Defaults
Convert colors to grayscale
Specifies that all colors in a document are printed only as greyscale.
Include transparent objects
If selected, the reduction in print quality for bitmaps also applies to the transparent
areas of objects.

Figure 15: Options LibreOffice Print dialog
Reduce bitmaps
Specifies that bitmaps are printed with reduced quality. The resolution can only be
reduced and not increased.
Resolution
Specifies the maximum print quality in DPI. The resolution can only be reduced and not
increased.
High print quality
High print quality corresponds to a resolution of 300dpi.
Normal print quality
Normal print quality corresponds to a resolution of 200dpi.

Printing | 41

Note
Reducing the amount of data sent by LibreOffice to the printer increases the print
speed because the print files are smaller. This makes it easier for printers with a
smaller memory when printing large files. However, reducing print data can result
in slightly lower print quality.
Reduce transparency
If selected, transparent objects are printed like normal, non-transparent objects,
depending on your selection in the following two option buttons.
Automatically
Specifies that the transparency is only printed if the transparent area covers less than a
quarter of the entire page.
No transparency
When selected, a transparency does not print.

Note
Transparencies cannot be sent directly to a printer. Transparencies must be
visible to be calculated by LibreOffice as bitmaps and sent to the printer.
Depending on bitmap size and the print resolution, a large amount of data may be
generated.
Warnings
Defines which warnings appear before printing begins.
Paper size
Select this option if a certain paper size is required for printing the current document. If
the paper size used in the document is not provided by the current printer, an error
message opens.
Paper orientation
Select this option if a certain paper orientation is required for printing the current
document. If the format used by the current document is not available from the printer,
an error message opens.
Transparency
Select this option if a warning is required if transparent objects are contained in the
document. When printing a document with transparencies, a dialogue box opens to
enable selection if the transparency is to be printed.
Reduce gradient
If selected, gradients are printed with reduced quality.
Gradient stripes
Specifies the maximum number of gradient stripes for printing.
Intermediate color
Specifies that gradients are only printed in a single intermediate color.

In Writer, Impress, and Draw, documents can be printed in the correct order to form a booklet or
brochure. Below are some examples. Actual brochure printing procedure depends on the
computer operating system and type of printer being used. You may need to experiment to find

format. The document can be edited when using Book view on the Status bar.
Click on Single page view to return the document to normal view.

Using Safe Mode
======================================================================

Safe Mode is used to restore LibreOffice after it has stopped working, fails to launch correctly, or
a file has become corrupted. It starts LibreOffice with a fresh user profile and disables hardware
acceleration.
Go to Help > Restart in Safe Mode on the Menu bar to open the Safe Mode dialog (Figure 19).

Note
It is recommended to use Safe Mode options from the top down (Figure 19)
because the options get more extreme from the top down.
Restore from backup
If you suspect that the problems were caused by recent changes to LibreOffice’s working
state, this option may help you. Since LibreOffice keeps backups of previous
configurations and activated extensions, Restore from backup will allow you to restore the
user configuration, installed extensions (or both), to a previous known working state.
Configure
This Safe Mode option disables either all user extensions, hardware acceleration, or both
functions. This may help you if there are crashes on startup or visual glitches that are
often related to hardware acceleration.
Extensions
If you think that a corrupted extension is blocking or causing LibreOffice to crash, this
option will uninstall all user extensions and reset the state of any shared or bundled
extensions. In the case of shared, or bundled extensions, the option only works if a user
has the proper system access rights. It should be used with caution.
Reset to factory settings
If all of the above fails, this function will reset the settings and user interface modifications
(or the entire user profile) back to factory defaults.
Reset settings and user interface modifications
This function resets any user interface and configuration changes, but keeps items such
as personal dictionary, templates, and so on.
Reset entire user profile
This function erases all customized options and returns a user profile to the factory
default state.

Using Safe Mode | 49

Continue in Safe Mode
If you need to continue in Safe Mode, it allows you to work in LibreOffice with a temporary
profile that was created on startup. Any extensions or configuration options set up
previously have to be reconfigured before using. Keep in mind that any changes made to
the temporary user profile are lost after a restart.

Figure 19: Safe Mode dialog
Restart in Normal Mode
If you have started Safe Mode accidentally, this option discards any changes, terminating
Safe Mode, and restarting LibreOffice normally.
Apply Changes and Restart
Select this option to apply any of the above changes and restart LibreOffice.

Note
If problems are not solved using Safe Mode, selecting Advanced provides
instructions on receiving further aid.
Advanced can allow you to create a zip file of a corrupted user profile, and this
file can be uploaded to the bug tracking system for further investigation by the
LibreOffice developers. Remember that an uploaded user profile may also contain
sensitive information such as installed extensions, personal dictionaries, and
user-specific settings.
