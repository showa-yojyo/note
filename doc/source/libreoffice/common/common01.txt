Using Safe Mode
======================================================================

Safe Mode is used to restore LibreOffice after it has stopped working, fails to launch correctly, or
a file has become corrupted. It starts LibreOffice with a fresh user profile and disables hardware
acceleration.
Go to Help > Restart in Safe Mode on the Menu bar to open the Safe Mode dialog (Figure 19).

Note
It is recommended to use Safe Mode options from the top down (Figure 19)
because the options get more extreme from the top down.
Restore from backup
If you suspect that the problems were caused by recent changes to LibreOffice’s working
state, this option may help you. Since LibreOffice keeps backups of previous
configurations and activated extensions, Restore from backup will allow you to restore the
user configuration, installed extensions (or both), to a previous known working state.
Configure
This Safe Mode option disables either all user extensions, hardware acceleration, or both
functions. This may help you if there are crashes on startup or visual glitches that are
often related to hardware acceleration.
Extensions
If you think that a corrupted extension is blocking or causing LibreOffice to crash, this
option will uninstall all user extensions and reset the state of any shared or bundled
extensions. In the case of shared, or bundled extensions, the option only works if a user
has the proper system access rights. It should be used with caution.
Reset to factory settings
If all of the above fails, this function will reset the settings and user interface modifications
(or the entire user profile) back to factory defaults.
Reset settings and user interface modifications
This function resets any user interface and configuration changes, but keeps items such
as personal dictionary, templates, and so on.
Reset entire user profile
This function erases all customized options and returns a user profile to the factory
default state.

Continue in Safe Mode
If you need to continue in Safe Mode, it allows you to work in LibreOffice with a temporary
profile that was created on startup. Any extensions or configuration options set up
previously have to be reconfigured before using. Keep in mind that any changes made to
the temporary user profile are lost after a restart.

Figure 19: Safe Mode dialog
Restart in Normal Mode
If you have started Safe Mode accidentally, this option discards any changes, terminating
Safe Mode, and restarting LibreOffice normally.
Apply Changes and Restart
Select this option to apply any of the above changes and restart LibreOffice.

Note
If problems are not solved using Safe Mode, selecting Advanced provides
instructions on receiving further aid.
Advanced can allow you to create a zip file of a corrupted user profile, and this
file can be uploaded to the bug tracking system for further investigation by the
LibreOffice developers. Remember that an uploaded user profile may also contain
sensitive information such as installed extensions, personal dictionaries, and
user-specific settings.
