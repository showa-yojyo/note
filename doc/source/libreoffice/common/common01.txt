Working with documents
======================================================================

New documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

LibreOffice has multiple methods for creating a new document:
•

Open the LibreOffice Start Center then click on the name of a LibreOffice module. For
example, click on Impress Presentation and a new presentation is created.

•

Click on Templates in the Start Center and the available LibreOffice templates are
displayed. Click on the required template to create a new file and the LibreOffice module
opens with a new document.

•

Go to File > New on the Menu bar and select the type of document from the submenu
that opens. The applicable LibreOffice module also opens.

•

Click on the downward triangle ▼ next to New on the Standard toolbar and select the
type of document from that context menu. For example, click on Drawing and a new
drawing is created. The applicable LibreOffice module also opens.

•

Click on New on the Standard toolbar and a new document is created by the LibreOffice
module. For example, if Writer is open and active, this icon will create a new Writer
document.

•

Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N (macOS ⌘+N) to create a new document. The type
of document created depends on which LibreOffice module is open and active. For
example, if Calc is open and active, a new spreadsheet is created.

•

Go to File > Wizards on the Menu bar and select the type of document from the options
available in the submenu.

Opening existing documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To open an existing LibreOffice document in the appropriate module, use one of the following
methods. .
•

Click Open File in the Start Center and select the file.

•

Go to File > Open on the Menu bar and select the file.

•

Click on Open on the Standard toolbar and select the file.

•

Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O (macOS ⌘+O) and select the file.

•

Click Recent Documents in the Start Center and select a recent file from the Center.

Working with documents | 33

•

Go to File > Recent Documents on the Menu bar and select the file from the files
displayed in the context menu.

Notes
Note that the previous names or locations of files that have been renamed or
relocated may still be in the Start Center, and clicking on those types of filenames
will generate an error. To remove the file from the Start Center, hover the cursor
over the thumbnail until an X appears in the upper right corner, and then click on
the X.
When you are selecting a LibreOffice file from the Start Center, Open dialog, or
file browser you can limit the files seen by file type. For example, you select Text
Documents as the file type, only documents that Writer can open are displayed.
If you need to work with files on remote servers, see Chapter 10, Working with
File Formats, Security, and Exporting.
Also, LibreOffice can open files compatible with the Open Document Format
(ODF), which includes many formats from Microsoft. For example, LO can open
MS Word files (*.doc or *.docx) in Writer, MS Excel files (*.xls or *.xlsx) can be
opened in Calc; MS PowerPoint files (*.ppt or *.pptx) can be opened in Impress,
and so on. See Chapter 10, Working with File Formats, Security and Exporting for
more information about working with different file types.

Saving documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

LibreOffice documents can be saved with one of the following methods:
•

Save — can save all changes made, keeping the current filename and location of the file.
– Go to File > Save on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S (macOS ⌘+S).
– Click on Save on the Standard toolbar.

•

Save As — can create a new document, change the filename or file format, or save the
file in a different location on a computer system.
– Go to File > Save As on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S (macOS ⌘+Shift+S).
– Click on the downward triangle ▼ next to Save on the Standard toolbar and select
Save As from the context menu.

•

Save a Copy — can save a copy of the current document, for example, in a different
location on the computer system. The current document remains open for more editing.
– Go to File > Save a Copy on the Menu bar.
– Click on the downward triangle ▼ next to Save on the Standard toolbar and select
Save a Copy from the context menu.

•

Save All — can save all the files that are open in LibreOffice. Go to File > Save All on
the Menu bar. This option is only available when more than one LibreOffice document is
open.

34 | Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics

Saving documents automatically
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need LibreOffice to save files automatically, you can use the AutoRecovery function. When
files are saved automatically, LibreOffice will overwrite the last saved state of the file. To set up
automatic file saving, do the following:
1)

Go to Tools > Options > Load/Save > General (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences >
Load/Save > General) on the Menu bar.

2)

In Save, select the option AutoRecovery information every and set the time interval in the
box, for example 10 minutes.

3)

Click OK to save the selection and close the dialog.

Using the Navigator
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Navigator is available as a dialog or Sidebar deck, and it lists all objects contained in a
document in categories. Examples can be seen in examples from Impress and Writer (Figure 9
and Figure 11). The Navigator can be opened with one of the following methods:
•

Navigator dialog: go to View > Navigator on the Menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut
F5 for Windows and macOS, or Ctrl+Shift+F5 for Linux.

•

Navigator deck on the Sidebar: click on the Navigator icon on the right of the Sidebar, or
use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Ctrl+4 for Windows and Linux, or ⌥+⌘+4 for macOS.

•

To close the Navigator, click on the X on the right of the title bar, or use the keyboard
shortcut. The categories are specific to each LibreOffice module. Click on the right
chevron > next to each category name to open the list of objects contained in each
category. Also, the Navigator provides some functions that are specific to each
LibreOffice module.

Figure 9: Example of Impress Navigator dialog
The Navigator provides an easy method of locating and selecting objects in a document. If
possible you should give each object an easily identified name so you can easily locate an
object, instead of using default names such as Sheet1, Table1, or Image2, and so on. Right-click
on an object in the Navigator dialog, or Sidebar deck and select Rename from the context menu.

Displaying multiple view of a document
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Users can open multiple views of the same document in LibreOffice. Each view can be displayed
in their own windows and LibreOffice can show different pages, use different zoom levels, or use
other settings. When a user makes a change to the document in one window, it will be reflected
in the other windows. For example, when using Writer, separate views of a document can be
used for copying or moving information from one page to another.
To open a new document window, go to Window > New Window on the Menu bar. In each open
window, the filename of the document will be displayed in the title bar. Figure 10 shows how
separate views of one document can be open at the same time. If other LibreOffice documents
are open at the same time, the LibreOffice windows list also includes these other documents and
the active window has a check mark by its filename. You can switch between windows by clicking
on a name in the list or by clicking on the window itself if it is visible on the display.
To close a window, go to Window > Close Window on the Menu bar, use the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+W (macOS ⌘+W).

LibreOffice printing options
----------------------------------------------------------------------

General printing options
After you install a printer on a computer, the general printing options for LibreOffice can be
customized. Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Print (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences >
LibreOffice > Print) to open the Options LibreOffice Print dialog (Figure 15). The general print
options for LibreOffice are as follows:
Settings for
Specifies whether the print settings apply to direct printing or to printing to a file.
Defaults
Convert colors to grayscale
Specifies that all colors in a document are printed only as greyscale.
Include transparent objects
If selected, the reduction in print quality for bitmaps also applies to the transparent
areas of objects.

Figure 15: Options LibreOffice Print dialog
Reduce bitmaps
Specifies that bitmaps are printed with reduced quality. The resolution can only be
reduced and not increased.
Resolution
Specifies the maximum print quality in DPI. The resolution can only be reduced and not
increased.
High print quality
High print quality corresponds to a resolution of 300dpi.
Normal print quality
Normal print quality corresponds to a resolution of 200dpi.

Printing | 41

Note
Reducing the amount of data sent by LibreOffice to the printer increases the print
speed because the print files are smaller. This makes it easier for printers with a
smaller memory when printing large files. However, reducing print data can result
in slightly lower print quality.
Reduce transparency
If selected, transparent objects are printed like normal, non-transparent objects,
depending on your selection in the following two option buttons.
Automatically
Specifies that the transparency is only printed if the transparent area covers less than a
quarter of the entire page.
No transparency
When selected, a transparency does not print.

Note
Transparencies cannot be sent directly to a printer. Transparencies must be
visible to be calculated by LibreOffice as bitmaps and sent to the printer.
Depending on bitmap size and the print resolution, a large amount of data may be
generated.
Warnings
Defines which warnings appear before printing begins.
Paper size
Select this option if a certain paper size is required for printing the current document. If
the paper size used in the document is not provided by the current printer, an error
message opens.
Paper orientation
Select this option if a certain paper orientation is required for printing the current
document. If the format used by the current document is not available from the printer,
an error message opens.
Transparency
Select this option if a warning is required if transparent objects are contained in the
document. When printing a document with transparencies, a dialogue box opens to
enable selection if the transparency is to be printed.
Reduce gradient
If selected, gradients are printed with reduced quality.
Gradient stripes
Specifies the maximum number of gradient stripes for printing.
Intermediate color
Specifies that gradients are only printed in a single intermediate color.

format. The document can be edited when using Book view on the Status bar.
Click on Single page view to return the document to normal view.

Using Safe Mode
======================================================================

Safe Mode is used to restore LibreOffice after it has stopped working, fails to launch correctly, or
a file has become corrupted. It starts LibreOffice with a fresh user profile and disables hardware
acceleration.
Go to Help > Restart in Safe Mode on the Menu bar to open the Safe Mode dialog (Figure 19).

Note
It is recommended to use Safe Mode options from the top down (Figure 19)
because the options get more extreme from the top down.
Restore from backup
If you suspect that the problems were caused by recent changes to LibreOffice’s working
state, this option may help you. Since LibreOffice keeps backups of previous
configurations and activated extensions, Restore from backup will allow you to restore the
user configuration, installed extensions (or both), to a previous known working state.
Configure
This Safe Mode option disables either all user extensions, hardware acceleration, or both
functions. This may help you if there are crashes on startup or visual glitches that are
often related to hardware acceleration.
Extensions
If you think that a corrupted extension is blocking or causing LibreOffice to crash, this
option will uninstall all user extensions and reset the state of any shared or bundled
extensions. In the case of shared, or bundled extensions, the option only works if a user
has the proper system access rights. It should be used with caution.
Reset to factory settings
If all of the above fails, this function will reset the settings and user interface modifications
(or the entire user profile) back to factory defaults.
Reset settings and user interface modifications
This function resets any user interface and configuration changes, but keeps items such
as personal dictionary, templates, and so on.
Reset entire user profile
This function erases all customized options and returns a user profile to the factory
default state.

Using Safe Mode | 49

Continue in Safe Mode
If you need to continue in Safe Mode, it allows you to work in LibreOffice with a temporary
profile that was created on startup. Any extensions or configuration options set up
previously have to be reconfigured before using. Keep in mind that any changes made to
the temporary user profile are lost after a restart.

Figure 19: Safe Mode dialog
Restart in Normal Mode
If you have started Safe Mode accidentally, this option discards any changes, terminating
Safe Mode, and restarting LibreOffice normally.
Apply Changes and Restart
Select this option to apply any of the above changes and restart LibreOffice.

Note
If problems are not solved using Safe Mode, selecting Advanced provides
