Hyperlinks
======================================================================

In LibreOffice, hyperlinks allow you to create references to web pages and other elements in
remote locations.

Absolute and relative hyperlinks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two types of hyperlinks: absolute and relative.
•

An absolute hyperlink links to a web page, or file, that is outside the current domain or file
location. It must contain the full address of the target file, or web site, such as
https://libreoffice.org. An absolute hyperlink will stop working if its target is moved to a
new location in the internet.

•

A relative hyperlink contains an address that is relative to the document’s current file
location. A relative hyperlink stops working if the document is removed from the current
location.

Inserting hyperlinks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1)

Select the location where the hyperlink will be inserted.

2)

Go to Insert > Hyperlinks on the Menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K
(macOS ⌘+K) to open the Hyperlink dialog (Figure 105).

3)

On the left hand side, determine whether the hyperlink will be absolute or relative.

4)

Click Apply to insert the hyperlink into the document.

5)

Click Close or OK to close the dialog.

Tips
LibreOffice automatically converts website URLs into hyperlinks. To turn off this
function, go to Tools > AutoCorrect Options > Options and deselect URL
Recognition.
To change the color of hyperlinks, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice >
Application Colors (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice >
Application Colors), and scroll to the Unvisited links and/or Visited links
checkboxes. Select them, choose new colors from the color palettes for the links,
and click OK. Note that this color change changes the color for all hyperlinks
across all LibreOffice modules.

Note
In Writer and Calc, the Navigator can be used to insert hyperlinks. For
information, see the Writer Guide and Calc Guide.

Hyperlink types
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To choose a hyperlink type, go to Insert > Hyperlinks on the Menu bar or use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K (macOS ⌘+K) to open the Hyperlink dialog.
Internet
Select either Web or FTP protocol. Enter the required web address in the URL text box
and a name for the hyperlink in the Text text box (Figure 105).

Document
Links to another document or to another place in a document, commonly referred to as a
bookmark. Enter the details in the Path text box, or click on Open File to open a file
browser. Leave this blank if the link is to a target in the same document (Figure 107).
Optionally, specify a target, for example a specific slide in a presentation. Click on Target
in Document to open a dialog where a target can be selected. If the name of the target is
known, type it into the Target text box.

New Document
Links a new document. Select Edit now to edit the newly created document immediately
or Edit later to only create the hyperlink. Choose the type of document to create from the
File type drop-down list. Click on Select path to open a file browser so that a directory is
selected for the new document (Figure 108).
Further Settings
These settings are common to all hyperlink types, though some choices are more
relevant to some types of links.
Frame
Set the value to determine how the hyperlink opens. This applies to documents that
open in a web browser.
Form
Specifies if the link is to be presented as text or as a button.
Text
Specifies the text that will be visible to the user.
Name
Applicable to HTML documents. It specifies text that will be added as a NAME attribute
in the HTML code behind the hyperlink.
