Templates
======================================================================

A template is a document that contains user-specified formatting styles, graphics, tables, objects,
and other information. LibreOffice can use a template to generate new documents with a
common content and a common format. For example, you can add the outline of a report and
also define paragraph and character styles in a document, save the document as a template, and
then use the template to create a new document with the same report outline and styles.
All documents in LibreOffice are based on templates. The software has a number of predefined
templates that can be used to create different types of documents, including business letters,
presentations, or drawings. Templates can be created to suit your requirements. Also, templates
can be downloaded from the LibreOffice website using the following link:
https://extensions.libreoffice.org.
If a blank document is created in LibreOffice, then the software uses the appropriate LibreOffice
default template. If required, this default template can be replaced by a custom template to suit
user requirements, see “Setting default template” on page 174 for more information.

Custom LibreOffice templates
----------------------------------------------------------------------

User-created templates are located in the My Templates folder and the next time LibreOffice is
started, those templates appear in the LibreOffice startup window and the Select a Template
dialog.

Hyperlinks
======================================================================

In LibreOffice, hyperlinks allow you to create references to web pages and other elements in
remote locations.

Absolute and relative hyperlinks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two types of hyperlinks: absolute and relative.
•

An absolute hyperlink links to a web page, or file, that is outside the current domain or file
location. It must contain the full address of the target file, or web site, such as
https://libreoffice.org. An absolute hyperlink will stop working if its target is moved to a
new location in the internet.

•

A relative hyperlink contains an address that is relative to the document’s current file
location. A relative hyperlink stops working if the document is removed from the current
location.

Inserting hyperlinks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1)

Select the location where the hyperlink will be inserted.

2)

Go to Insert > Hyperlinks on the Menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K
(macOS ⌘+K) to open the Hyperlink dialog (Figure 105).

3)

On the left hand side, determine whether the hyperlink will be absolute or relative.

4)

Click Apply to insert the hyperlink into the document.

5)

Click Close or OK to close the dialog.

Tips
LibreOffice automatically converts website URLs into hyperlinks. To turn off this
function, go to Tools > AutoCorrect Options > Options and deselect URL
Recognition.
To change the color of hyperlinks, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice >
Application Colors (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice >
Application Colors), and scroll to the Unvisited links and/or Visited links
checkboxes. Select them, choose new colors from the color palettes for the links,
and click OK. Note that this color change changes the color for all hyperlinks
across all LibreOffice modules.

Note
In Writer and Calc, the Navigator can be used to insert hyperlinks. For
information, see the Writer Guide and Calc Guide.

Hyperlink types
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To choose a hyperlink type, go to Insert > Hyperlinks on the Menu bar or use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K (macOS ⌘+K) to open the Hyperlink dialog.
Internet
Select either Web or FTP protocol. Enter the required web address in the URL text box
and a name for the hyperlink in the Text text box (Figure 105).
