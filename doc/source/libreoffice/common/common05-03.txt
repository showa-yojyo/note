Editing images or graphics
======================================================================

LibreOffice provides many tools for editing images
and graphics. These tools are described in more detail in the relevant user
guide for each LibreOffice module. Editing images, or graphics, consists of the
following: •

Cropping, resizing, modifying, filtering, and positioning.

•

Wrapping text around images.

•

Using images as backgrounds and watermarks.

168

For complex editing, it is recommended to use a graphics application, such as
Gimp, or Inkscape. The edited image, or graphic, can then be inserted into
LibreOffice.

Image toolbar
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When an image is inserted, or an image is selected in the
document, the Image toolbar opens automatically. If the Image toolbar does not
open, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select Image from the submenu.
Two other toolbars also become available when an image is selected: •

Image Filter toolbar, which can be used as a floating toolbar.

•

Color toolbar, which opens as a separate floating toolbar.

Using these three toolbars together, corrections and adjustments can be applied
to an image. Also, special effects can be applied, such as transparency, color
adjustment, flipping and rotation, and special effect filters.

Cropping
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If only a part of an image, or graphic, is to be used in a document, it
can be cropped. LibreOffice provides two ways to crop an image, or graphic: •

Crop tool — available as a tool on toolbars, or in a context menu after
right-clicking on an image, or graphic. The Crop tool provides a quick and easy
way to crop an image, or graphic.

•

Crop page in the Writer Image dialog — accessed by right-clicking on the image,
or graphic, and selecting Properties in the context menu. The Crop page provides
more control when cropping.

Note When an image, or graphic, is inserted into a LibreOffice document and is
cropped, the image, or graphic, itself is not cropped. LibreOffice masks the
parts of the image, or graphic, that have been cropped. If the document is
exported as HTML, the original image, or graphic, is also exported. For
exporting individual cropped images, or graphics, see “Exporting” on page 197.

Resizing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To fit an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document, it may have
to be resized. The quickest way to resize an image, or graphic, is to use the
selection handles as shown by the following example. 1)

Click on an image, or graphic, to display the selection handles.

Figure 112: Example of resizing an image Editing images or graphics | 169

2)

Position the cursor over one of the selection handles and the cursor changes
shape, giving a graphical representation of the resizing direction as follows: –
Corner handles simultaneously resizes both width and height of an image. –
Horizontal handles resizes the height of an image. – Vertical handles resizes
the width of an image.

3)

Click on a selection handle and drag to resize the image, or graphic. During
resizing, a ghost image appears helping to resize an image, or graphic, (Figure
112).

4)

To maintain the original height and width proportions of an image while dragging
using a selection handle, hold down the Shift key before dragging a selection
handle. Remember to release the Shift key before releasing the selection handle.

Positioning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After inserting an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document,
it may have to be repositioned to achieve the correct document format. The
quickest way to resize an image, or graphic, is to use the cursor as shown by
the following example. 1)

Select an image, or graphic, to display the selection handles.

2)

Move the cursor over a selected image, or graphic, and the cursor changes shape
to a grabbing cursor. The grabbing shape depends on the computer setup and the
computer operating system.

3)

Click and drag the selected image, or graphic, to the desired position. During
movement, a ghost image appears helping with repositioning (Figure 113).

4)

Release the cursor when the image, or graphic, is in the desired position.

Tip The arrow keys on the keyboard can also be used to quickly move a selected
image, or graphic, into a new position.

Rotating images
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After inserting an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice
document, it can be rotated to achieve the correct document format. The quickest
way to rotate an image, or graphic, is to use the cursor as shown by the
following example. 1)

Click on an image, or graphic, to display the selection handles.

2)

Click again (NOT double-click) on the selected image, or graphic, switching on
rotation mode, or go to Format > Rotate on the Menu bar.

170

Note Using a double-click on an image, or graphic, switches on text editing mode
for the selected image, or graphic. 3)

Move the cursor over one of the corner handles and the cursor changes shape
indicating the movement direction.

4)

Click on a corner selection handle and move in the direction required to rotate
the object. Only the corner selection handles are active for rotation.

5)

When satisfied with the rotation, release the cursor.

6)

To restrict the rotation angles to multiples of 15 degrees, press and hold the
Shift key while rotating the image. This is useful for rotating images through a
right angle, for example from portrait to landscape. Remember to release the
Shift key before releasing the cursor.

7)

To change the rotation center of the object, click and drag the central pivot
point to the desired position before rotating. The central pivot point can be
moved to any position on the document, even outside of the image boundaries.

Flipping
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After inserting an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document, it
can be flipped either vertically, or horizontally. Depending on which
LibreOffice module is being used, use one of the following methods to quickly
flip an image, or graphic: •

Right-click on the selected image, or graphic, and select Flip > Vertically or
Horizontally from the context menu.

•

Click on Vertically, or Horizontally on the Line and Filling toolbar.

•

Click on Flip Vertically, or Flip Horizontally on the Image toolbar.

•

Go to Format > Flip > Vertically, or Horizontally on the Menu bar.

•

Go to Format > Rotate or Flip > Flip Vertically, or Flip Horizontally on the
Menu bar

•

Click on Flip Vertically, or Flip Horizontally in the Position and Size panel on
the Properties deck of the Sidebar.

Arranging
----------------------------------------------------------------------

LibreOffice organizes images and graphics in a stack. The image, or
graphic, on the top level of a stack covers the images and graphics on the lower
levels, if any overlapping occurs. Select images, or graphics, and use one of
the following methods to change the stack level: •

Click on the required arrange tool on the Line and Filling toolbar. Editing
images or graphics | 171

•

Right-click on selected objects and select Arrange from the context menu, then
select the required arrange option from the sub-context menu.

•

Go to Format > Arrange on the Menu bar and select an option from the submenu.

•

Use the keyboard shortcut available for each arrangement option.

The stack level of each image, or graphic, can be changed. The options available
for arranging the stack level of images, or graphics are as follows: Bring to
Front Selected object is moved in front of all other objects. Keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Shift++ (macOS ⌘+Shift++). Bring Forward Selected object is moved one level
up in the stack. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl++ (macOS ⌘++). Send Backward Selected
object is moved one level down in the stack. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+– (macOS
⌘+–). Send to Back Selected object is moved behind all other objects. Keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+Shift+– (macOS ⌘+Shift+–). In Front of Object Moves the first
selected object in front of the second selected object. Select the first object,
then click on the second object and the objects swap position. Behind Object
Moves the first selected object behind the second selected object. Select the
first object, then click on the second object and the objects swap position.
Reverse Swaps the stacking order of two selected objects.

Alignment and positioning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When an image, or graphic, is added to a document, the
alignment and positioning has to be selected in respect to text and other
objects on a document page. Arrangement Is the positioning of an image, or
graphic, on an imaginary vertical axis. Arrangement controls how images, or
graphics are stacked upon each other, or relative to the text. Alignment is the
vertical, or horizontal positioning of an image, or graphic, in relation to the
selected anchor point. Anchoring Is a reference point for that an image, or
graphic, is fixed in a document. This reference, or anchor point can be a page,
frame, cell, paragraph, or character. An image, or graphic, always has an anchor
point. Text wrapping In a document refers to the relation of images and graphics
to the surrounding text. Options for text wrapping allow the text to wrap around
an image, or graphic, as follows: – One or both sides of the image, or graphic.
– Above or below of the image, or graphic. 172 | Chapter 5, Working with Images
and Graphics

– Allow text overprint of the image, or graphic. – Allow of the image, or
graphic, to cover the text. – Treat the image, or graphic, as a separate
paragraph, or character.

Exporting
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use another graphics application to edit an image, or graphic, the
file is exported directly from the document. The following procedure is an
example only. Actual procedure depends on the computer operating system and
computer setup. 1)

Right-click on the image, or graphic.

2)

Select Save from the context menu to open the Image Export dialog (Figure 115).

Compressing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If an image, or graphic, has a large file size, it can be compressed
to reduce the file size. This results in a smaller file size for the document,
but may result in a loss of quality when the image, or graphic, is compressed.
The following procedure is an example only. Actual procedure depends on the
computer operating system and computer setup. 1)

Right-click on the image, or graphic.

2)

Select Compress from the context menu to open the Compress Image dialog (Figure
116).

3)

Use options available in Compression and Resolution to compress the image, or
graphic.

4)

If necessary, click on Calculate New Size and check the file file size of the
compressed image, or graphic.

5)

Click on OK to save the changes and close the dialog.

6)

If the resulting image is not acceptable, undo the changes and repat the
procedure using different compression settings.
